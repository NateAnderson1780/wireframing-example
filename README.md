### Intro to Wireframing

This repository has the skeleton of an application already built for you. We have `Event`'s which each have a title, location, host, description, and a start time.

The setup including the models, database, and controller has been created for you.Your job is to create a wireframe for two different views, then build them!

1. A view that lists all of the events with their title and location.
2. A view that shows all the details (data) of one specific event.
